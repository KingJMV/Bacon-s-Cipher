Fun Facts

1. The affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter.

2. It is useful in many branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, number theory, applied mathematics; as well as in physics, including hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and particularly, quantum field theory.

3. The objective importance of mathematical analysis as a means of studying functions.

4. Each letter is enciphered with the function (ax + b) mod 26, where b is the magnitude of the shift.
