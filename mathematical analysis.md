# Mathematical Analysis

## Analysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with limits and related theories, such as differentiation, integration, measure, sequences, series, and analytic functions. Analysis evolved from calculus, which involves the elementary concepts and techniques of analysis. These theories are usually studied in the context of real and complex numbers and functions.

Fun Facts

1. In the 14th century, mathematical analysis originated with Madhava in South India, who developed the fundamental ideas of the infinite series expansion of a function, the power series, the Taylor series, and the rational approximation of an infinite series.

2. Karl Weierstrass was one of the leaders in rigor in analysis and was known as the "father of modern analysis." In addition, he is considered one of the greatest mathematics teachers of all-time.

3. It is useful in many branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, number theory, applied mathematics; as well as in physics, including hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and particularly, quantum field theory.

4. The objective importance of mathematical analysis as a means of studying functions.

5. In mathematics, real analysis is the branch of mathematical analysis that studies the behavior of real numbers, sequences and series of real numbers, and real functions.
